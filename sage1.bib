    abstract = { A review is given of recent developments in energy-dispersive x-ray emission spectroscopy, with the aim of providing both an introductory and usefully practical look at this innovative field. The review begins with the first principles of x-ray production and observation, including a brief comparison of the performance capabilities of different types of detectors, but then specializes to a major extent in solid state x-ray spectrometers, which have led to the most significant new developments and applications. Evidence is presented which suggests that we are nearing an asymptotic limit in the attainment of ever better resolution with these types of systems. Applications that have been made possible by significant improvements in system resolution are discussed, but in the context of the need for a realistic appraisal of over-all system requirements. The great advantages offered by the marriage of silicon x-ray spectrometers to scanning electron microscopes and electron microprobe analyzers are reviewed and illustrated. }

    abstract = { The trace element contaminations, introduced by grinding or sieving samples of Specpure silica and calcium carbonate in various devices in common usage, have been measured using emission spectrometry. The tungsten carbide vial introduced large amounts of Co and Ti. The alumina mortar introduced Al, Cr, Fe, Ga, and Zr. The alumina-ceramic vial introduced Al, Cu, Fe, Ga, Li, Ti, B, Ba, Co, Mn, Zn, and Zr. The boron carbide mortar (except for B), the agate mortar, and the Lucite grinding vials introduced little or no contamination, as did sifting with nylon sieves. Stainless steel or brass sieves introduced appreciable levels of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, and Zn. The contamination Cu, Pb, and Zn from sieving with the brass was greatest in the smaller size fraction. Pregrinding an aliquot of the sample is recommended. Greater reductions in contamination from the grinding material were noted by pregrinding with soft fine CaCO3 than with SiO2. Cross contamination from previously ground samples was demonstrated to be a major source of contamination. Grinding with the hard, more abrasive SiO2 removed more of the cross contaminants than did the CaCO3. }

    abstract = { Radioisotopes are radioactive versions of the natural chemical elements, differing from these only in their nuclear mass and in their ability to emit radiations. They are produced mainly by neutron bombardment of ordinary materials in a nuclear reactor.The most important radiations are beta particles (fast electrons of nuclear origin) and gamma rays (penetrating electromagnetic radiations). These are detected with ionization chambers, Geiger counters or scintillation counters. In production control, the absorption or scattering of radiations is used as a measure of material thickness, and in some cases, of its atomic number.Radioactive tracers aid in production research in rapid determination of mixing efficiencies and hold-up times. Tracers are also used in the non-destructive testing of materials and components and in more basic research into alloy structure. In this latter research, photographic films are used to produce autoradiographs which show the microscopic distribution of radioactively labelled constituents. Radioactivation by neutron irradiation enables certain impurities to be assayed at sub-microgram levels without chemical separation.The wear of engine parts can be measured, in a fraction of the time taken for orthodox methods, by making the parts in question radioactive and measuring the worn radioactive debris in circulating lubricant. Cutting tools can be measured similarly by assaying radioactive debris attached to the swarf.For many purposes gamma radiography supplements X-radiography or replaces it as a cheaper alternative. The greater manoeuvrability of gamma-ray sources is of especial advantage in the radiography of assembled engines. }

No decorative lighting for commercial purposes and no luminous sign can be truly satisfactory unless the scheme that is to be carried out by the lighting engineer has in the first place been conceived by an artist pursuing an aesthetic conception regardless of the ultimate purpose of the installation.The author recommends that fluorescent light sources used in such installations should have a predominantly red spectral emission. Incandescent sources can be usefully combined with fluorescent sources. The completed lighting scheme should include one or more spots of colour, either light sources or lighted surfaces, which serve as tonal points of reference by which the colour value of the general lighting can be located. }

It can be derived from the thickness profile got by passing the material between loaded cylindrical rollers, provided the effects of different test conditions and the relation between thickness and mass are known. These have been examined for jute finisher card slivers.The effects of roller diameter, compressive force, and throughput speed have been included in a single relation. Diameter affected the area compressed only, and through put speed was unimportant for compression times longer than 0.1 sec. Thickness was proportional to mass for the short lengths of sliver under instantaneous compression. Fiber moisture content and denier had negligible effect on the thickness over the ranges of practical interest, fiber alignment being more important.The compression characteristics of slivers loaded statically under a plane shoe are discussed, also. }

Some particular characteristics of the conduct problem child relevant to the education process are outlined. Also considered are factors relevant to remediational efforts within the public school setting, including the problem of group versus individual techniques, the role of mental health professionals, the place of other than classroom treatment, the goals of the special class, and the utilization in the regular class of techniques developed in the special class. }

    abstract = { A shop lighting installation must be related not only to the size and shape of the shop but also to the class of merchandise displayed and the type of customer. Current techniques of window lighting are dealt with in some detail, and in particular the problems arising from the necessity of concealing the lamps, the use of dark or translucent louvres and the reduction of daylight window reflections. Where shop interiors are concerned one of the chief points at issue is the choice between general and localised lighting. Recommendations are made of suitable colours of light sources and the importance of blending the light of filament and fluorescent lamps is emphasised. The current fashion for dark ceilings is discussed together with the importance of wall lighting to display the merchandise and relieve the gloomy effect otherwise created by this method of lighting.The paper gives a brief survey of after-hour lighting in some representative shopping centres made in 1949–50 and the spring of 1954. The paper closes with a brief résumé of some of the types of lamps and equipment now available for shop and shop window lighting. }

    abstract = { In introducing the subject the authors suggest a classification of boilers on a pressure basis. Alternative methods of drum construction are reviewed, leading to an investigation of the effects of higher saturated steam temperatures on the physical characteristics of the metal and the factor of safety. Attention is paid to the analysis of stresses induced in the drums of large high-pressure installations, with comments on the limitations of standard design rules and formulae. Similar treatment of the subject of boiler tubes follows, attention being directed particularly to the combined effects of temperature and stress.The importance of accurate estimation of furnace exit temperature, especially in relation to superheat, and the effects of modern designs of water-cooled furnaces are then discussed. The influence of radiant heat emission from non-luminous gases in the convection passes is emphasized. A simple graphical method for determining the rate of natural circulation is outlined and the retarding influence of high pressure is discussed.Orthodox designs of high-pressure boilers, the relative merits of which are compared, present no serious difficulty in operation, providing adequate attention is paid to feed water treatment, some aspects of which are discussed. Further developments are contingent upon the economic extension of the range of commercial heat-resisting metals; the adoption of more logical and adequate rules and regulations governing design; and closer investigation into the behaviour of tubes, etc., under high pressures and temperatures and subject to the conditions prevailing in a boiler when in service. }

Techniques are described wherein available standard samples are used in combination with synthetic laboratory-made standards and spectroscopic buffers These methods utilize a single set of three to six standards for the analysis of each class of alloys For example, one set of standards is used for the analysis of lead-base, lead-tin-base (solders) and tin-base alloys; and in like manner a single set of standards for each of copper-base, aluminum-base, zinc-base, and magnesium-base alloys, and for ceramics.The availability of standard samples, their usefulness, and their limitations are discussed Data are presented to indicate the precision and accuracy of the methods as applied to various base materials. }

The use of spectroscopy, in its various disciplines, is discussed from historical and everyday use vantage points. A narrative scheme is used to illustrate the various facets of spectrochemical procedures and applications to crime investigations. However, the source of scientific principle is indicated and the reader is referred to the literature for additional comment. The use of spectroscopy in criminalistics is not new but it has the vigor, capability, and promise of youth. }

    abstract = { Vigilance as a human factors area is concerned with the fact that man is much less capable as a detector of signals under operational conditions than would be indicated by laboratory measures of his sensory thresholds. The area, which is obviously important for the analysis of man's visual capabilities in the operation of manned space systems, is re-examined with the help of a theoretical model that introduces a decision–theory approach to the observing response phase of the vigilance task. After a critical review of the vigilance literature, examples are presented of the application of this approach to the solution of human factors problems of the sort that might arise in manned space missions. The model is also used to suggest the kind of research that would make it easier to predict field monitoring performance from laboratory experiments. }

    abstract = { Two different ways of studying nonviolence are distinguished, depending on whether one uses explicit or implicit definitions of nonviolence used by others, whether writers on the subject or people who say they have practiced nonviolence, or one tries to develop one's own definition. The second approach is followed in this article in order to avoid ritualistic repetition of what others have regarded as nonviolence.Nonviolence is seen as an effort to influence, and a typology of influence techniques is developed, based on a simple model of how human actions are decided upon. This typology has as its main axis a distinction between positive and negative techniques of influence, i.e. the distinction between techniques that facilitate the execution of positive actions and techniques that impede the execution of negative actions. Nonviolence is then defined in a negative and a positive sense: negative nonviolence would include all possible techniques of influence short of 'deprivation of biological health' (called violence in the narrow sense) and positive nonviolence would exclude all negative techniques of influence (called violence in the broad sense).Current forms of nonviolent resistance or intervention are then examined in this perspective, and five main types are distinguished: a symbolic form that aims at pointing out to the adversary what are positive and what are negative actions; the use of physical means such as nonviolent sabotage, emigration, escape and their positive counterpart: close social contact; the use of positive and negative sanctions; the use of positive and negative 'amplification' (a way of increasing the impact the adversary's actions have, whether they are good or bad) and role-playing which includes such techniques as non cooperation and civil disobedience.In the final evaluation it is pointed out that adherents of nonviolence should do more to develop positive techniques of influence, and that many of the negative techniques differ little from biological violence. }

    abstract = { (Précis of a course of lectures on Industrial Legislation)by M.-A. FlammeLecturer at the University of BrusselsThe author begins by defining « Industrial Legislation » as an academic field. This subject is optional for undergraduates of the Faculties of Laws of the four Belgian Universities, in the last two semesters of their studies. But its scope has never yet been determined precisely. French, and Belgian, authors writing on Industrial Legislation, in point of fact treat only of labour legislation — classed in Belgian universities under « Social Legislation ».Yet, between Private and Public Law, there is an important sector, the limits of which are not closely defined, comprising inter alia Transport, Motive Power, and Mines, considered as « the big three » of Industrial Legislation.The author reviews: rail transport, both railways proper and the rural lines operated respectively (in Belgium) by the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Belges and the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Vicinaux; tramways (of which the Brussels Intercommunal régie or « directly operated public enterprise » is the most advanced example); road transport, both passengers and goods; inland waterways transport; air transport, for each of which the regime of concessions, of control, and, in some cases, of direct operation comes under consideration.The second chapter deals with power production and distribution; the third with mines. Further, the doctrinal aspects of the freedom of trade and of industry are studied, in Law. In conclusion, the author finds that the title Industrial Legislation, is somewhat of a misnomer. Economists often place industry in opposition to trade, whilst jurists group them both under « Commercial Law ». Speaking more generally, human industry is a global concept. And it is hard to say under what heading industrial ownership, distinct or not from freedom of trade and industry, is to be classed, in view of problems such as that of the civil or the public rights involved.Industrial Legislation would appear to come best under Economic Administrative Law, or Economic Public Law, concerned with State regulatory powers and protectionism, or even interventionism.Freedom or Control of industry? The choice between the two is the very crux of modern existence. }
